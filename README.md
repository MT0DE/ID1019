This is documentation of everything associated with the programing course "Programing 2" at KTH.  
This course introduces how to think *recursivly* together with programming in the Elixir Language.  
Elixir is a superset of the Erlang Language, which means that Elixir code is also valid Erlang code and is compiled on the Erlang VM.

Each subdirectory contains my written code in Elixir, however this course introduces a new language together with functional programming and as such,
code-skeltons are provided in order to help the student to understand how this language can be utilised.  

> Projects that have been completed as part of the course are:  
> (**OBLIGATORY**) The ***E-level*** tasks:
> 1. Derivation
> 2. key-value database
> 3. Evaluate mathematical expressions
> 4. Towers of Hanoi
> 5. Advent of Code 2022 Day 1
> 6. Monte Carlo
> 7. Train-shunting
> 8. Huffman
> 9. Surprise Assignment (?)

> (**OPTIONAL**) ***Higher grade*** tasks:
> 1. An interpreter
> 2. Higher Order functions
> 3. Advent of Code 2022 Day 16
> 4. The Eating Philosophers

NOTE. Erlang is a superset of the "prolog" language, a logical programming language which I have previous knowledge of.
